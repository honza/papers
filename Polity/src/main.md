Introduction
============

In this paper, I will argue that the current church government structure at
Bedford Baptist Church is inefficient and not biblical.  I believe that the
biblical standard for church governance has been eroded over time and should be
restored.  I believe that God desires our obedience to his Word.  My hope is
that anyone reading this document will devote the time and effort necessary to
study these matters so that we can enter the congregational discussions with
insight and wisdom.

Before we dive into the main material, I would like to briefly discuss my
motivation for writing this paper. 

Scripture
---------

First and foremost, I want us to have a very high view of Scripture.  In 2
Timothy 3:16-17, we read that

> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for
> reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of
> God may be complete, equipped for every good work.[^1]

The Bible says about itself that every word in it was spoken by God himself.
The Creator of the universe isn't a silent dictator but a loving Father who
speaks with and listens to his children.  We believe that the Bible is a record
of what God has spoken to his people throughout history.  We believe that no
errors were made when those words were written down and passed down the
generations.

In Matthew 4:4, Jesus says

> It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
> comes from the mouth of God.'

which indicates to us that we need the words of God to live fully.  This means
that we need to be careful when reading the Bible so that we don't
misunderstand what God is trying to communicate to us.  I believe that we have
strayed from the biblical picture of church organization and this is my attempt
to be faithful to the word of God.

D. A. Carson said:

> Those who don't have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey
> it.[^16]

Further, I don't want us to deceive ourselves.  As Augustine said:

> If you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don't like, it
> is not the gospel you believe, but yourself.[^2]

Francis Chan speaks of our tendency to memorize Scripture verses without acting
on them.  He compares Christianity to a game of *Simon says*.  In *Simon says*,
you listen to what Simon says and then you have to do it.  Chan says that in
Christianity, we often feel like we just have to memorize what Jesus says but
we don't have to do it.[^14]  I want us to be doers and not just hearers of the
Word[^15].

Effectiveness
-------------

It has become apparent during the last few months that our church has become
ineffective in carrying out kingdom work.  Issues in many different areas of
church life take a significant amount of time to resolve.  We are currently
unable to quickly respond to urgent or unexpected problems.  If there is a more
efficient way of structuring the leadership of the church, I think it is our
responsibility to explore it[^7].

Church life
-----------

Many people in our church are discouraged by the politics and drama that seems
to be going on in the leadership.  There are different agendas being pushed and
people quickly tire of power struggles.  Instead of focusing on gossip,
lobbying and other worldly activities, let us look to God and his glory.

We want our people to be serving others, making disciples and bringing glory to
God.

Present state
=============

For completeness, this section will describe the current state of things at
Bedford Baptist Church when it comes to leadership organization.  I will try to
refrain from making any comments and focus on the description.

Boards and Committees
---------------------

According to the constitution of Bedford Baptist Church, there are currently
twenty-three boards and committees:  The Board of Deacons (15), the Board of
Trustees (9), the Christian Education Committee (12), the Finance Committee
(9), the Stewardship Committee (6), the Investment Committee (5), the Missions
Committee (9), the Women's Missionary Society, the Friendship Circle, the
Floral Committee (8), the Decorating Committee (4), the Greeters, the Ushers,
the Social Committee, the Music Committee (4), the Nominating Committee (9),
the Technical Management Committee, the Radio Management Committee, the
Visitation Committee, the Tellers (21), the Seniors Fellowship, the Church
Library Committee and the Office Help Committee[^4].

The sum of all the committees make up the church leadership.  There are over a
hundred people in the leadership of the church[^3].  The church currently has
around 250 members.

Deacons
-------

The constitution says that the board of deacons

> shall advise, assist and support the Pastoral Staff and cooperate with them
> in the administration of the spiritual affairs of the Church 

In essence, it says that the deacons, along with the pastors, are
administrative and spiritual leaders of the church.

Pastors
-------

The constitution says that

> The Pastor(s) report to the Board of Deacons.

and then it lists the qualifications for pastors:

> Shall be a person(s) having or seeking accreditation from a recognized
> theological institution and whose Christian character and qualifications are
> consistent with the doctrine and policy of the Church. The person(s) shall be
> spiritually and emotionally mature with proven leadership skills and
> demonstrated ability as team players.

Within the context of the constitution, the pastors are always spoken of as
staff of the church organization.  The constitution sets out rules on how
pastors are to be selected, employed and what the procedure is for dismissal.

Executive committee
-------------------

The Executive committee

> shall be responsible for the efficient management of the affairs of the
> Church business between business meetings

and it consists of Chairmen of all of the above committees.  It is understood
in this context that the business meeting is a meeting of the assembly of all
members of the church.  The Executive is the highest body of power, right under
the assembly of the people.

Congregational votes
--------------------

Important decisions within the church, such as budget approvals or the calling
of a pastor, are to be done through a congregational vote.  According to the
constitution

> every member shall have one vote.  All members are entitled to take part in
> the deliberations and vote at any and all meetings.  A simple majority vote
> of members present shall legally commit the Church to act in accordance with
> the motion.  However, a seventy five per cent (75%) majority is required for
> Budget Approval or a Constitution change and a ninety per cent (90%) majority
> is required for the calling of a Pastor(s).  In the event of a tie vote the
> Moderator or Vice Moderator shall have the deciding vote.

Roberts Rules of Order
----------------------

According to the constitution of Bedford Baptist Church, "the guide for the
conduct of meetings shall be as outlined in *Roberts Rules of Order*". Roberts
Rules of Order is a "codification of the present-day general parliamentary
law".[^5]  It describes in great detail how parliamentary societies should
conduct themselves with respect to the decision-making process.  It speaks of
numbers of votes necessary for decisions to be passed, who can call a meeting,
what constitutes a quorum in the different kinds of meetings, what meeting
minutes should look like and much more.  Roberts Rules of Order was first
published in 1876.

Description of biblical polity
==============================

Now that we have an idea of how church government works at Bedford Baptist
Church, we should survey the Bible to see what it teaches on proper church
polity.

The Bible prescribes a structure where the general flock of believers is
shepherded by a group of shepherds.

The New Testament describes two offices to be held within the local church: an
*elder* and a *deacon*.

Elders
------

The terms *elder*[^10], *overseer* (bishop)[^9] and *pastor*[^11] are used
interchangeably in the New Testament.  Elders were the ruling overseers of the
local church.  They were in charge of spiritual, practical and financial
matters.  Elders were versed in the Christian doctrine and had the respect of
their flock.  They weren't, however, rulers in the worldly sense.  Instead of
domineering, they sought to lead sacrificially and by example.

In our day, I picture an elder to be a mature Christian on whom you can depend
in all areas of life.  He will be with you in your sorrows and your joys.  He
will be a man of integrity and experience.  He will know the Word of God and
will be able to use it to correct and encourage.

Let me mention a few verses from the New Testament that use the word *elder*.

Acts 14:23

> And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and
> fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

Acts 15:1-6

> But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, "Unless you
> are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved." And
> after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul
> and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to
> the apostles and the elders about this question. So, being sent on their way
> by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in
> detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the
> brothers. When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and
> the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with
> them. But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up
> and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the
> law of Moses." The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider
> this matter.

Acts 15:22-23

> Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to
> choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.
> They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
> with the following letter: "The brothers, both the apostles and the elders,
> to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia,
> greetings.

Acts 16:4

> As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for
> observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who
> were in Jerusalem.

Acts 20:17

> Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to
> come to him.

Acts 21:17-18

> When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. On the
> following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.

1 Timothy 4:14

> Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the
> council of elders laid their hands on you.

1 Timothy 5:17

> Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially
> those who labor in preaching and teaching.

1 Timothy 5:19

> Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three
> witnesses.

Titus 1:5

> This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into
> order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you--

James 5:14

> Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let
> them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

1 Peter 5:1

> So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the
> sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be
> revealed:

1 Peter 5:5

> Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves,
> all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but
> gives grace to the humble."

2 John 1:1

> The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not
> only I, but also all who know the truth,

3 John 1:1

> The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.

In 1 Timothy 3:2-7, we find the qualifications for elders:

> Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife,
> sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a
> drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He
> must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children
> submissive, for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how
> will he care for God's church? He must not be a recent convert, or he may
> become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
> Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall
> into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.

If elders are to rule over God's household, they should have a proven ability
to lead.  This ability is demonstrated by their ability to manage their own
affairs.

The elder must be "able to teach", meaning they should have a solid grasp on
biblical doctrine and be able to explain the gospel truth plainly.  I take this
to mean that formal education isn't necessary to hold this office.  Even though
the term *elder* suggests an older man, Timothy was a young elder:

> Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers tan example in
> speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.  (1 Timothy 4:12)

The apostle Paul says to Timothy that elders ought to rule the local church.

> Let the elders who *rule* well be considered worthy of double honor,
> especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. (1 Timothy 5:17)

Additionally, I think having several elders be the ruling force in the church
makes practical sense.  When an urgent, unexpected need arises, the dozen or so
elders can all call each other on the phone and figure out what to do.  We
don't have to wait until the next meeting of the Finance committee to see if we
can afford to spend money.  Then, we don't have to wait for the Executive
committee to meet and pass a motion allowing this sum of money to be releases,
etc.  The ruling elders have the authority to do this among themselves.  This
can be very efficient and fast.

Deacons
-------

The Greek term for deacon literally means "helper".  I think Acts 6 provides a
great picture of what a deacon is supposed to do within the context of the
local church.  The issue was that the elders couldn't focus on preaching and
prayer *and* take care of the widows.  So they decided to set aside other
people to do just that---to feed the poor.  It speaks of "serving the tables".

Deacons help with the practical needs of daily life.  Their work is often
unseen but necessary.

In 1 Timothy 3:8-13, we find the qualifications for deacons:

> Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much
> wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.  They must hold the mystery of the faith
> with a clear conscience.  And let them also be tested first; then let them
> serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.  

The deacons' job is to help with the more practical needs within and outside
the church.  This may include shoveling the snow in the driveway, preparing
meals for church events, cleaning the church building, etc.  Currently, all
work that falls under Trustees would be appropriately handled by the deacons.

History
=======

In this section, I would like to show that the ideas presented in this paper
aren't new.  Indeed, they have a strong rooting in reformed tradition.

John Piper writes that

> from their earliest beginnings Baptists have held to the view that the two
> ongoing church offices presented in the New Testament are elders and deacons,
> and that only in more modern developments has the eldership largely
> disappeared.[^8]

The rest of the section is taken verbatim from "Rethinking the Governance
Structure at Bethlehem Baptist Church".  The following shows that faithful
Christians throughout history have interpreted the Bible the same way.

Issues with current system
==========================

Decision making
---------------

There is a bureaucratic web of proper procedure.  Before a decision can be
done, a great many different boards and committees need to have a chance to
discuss it.  Most committees meet once a month and it can take several months
before everyone can supply their input.

There is no complete account of how the government system works at Bedford
Baptist Church.  A newcomer to the leadership is at the mercy of others'
willingness to explain proper conduct.  This often results in miscommunication,
people having their feelings hurt and not enough things getting done.  On a
number of occasions, I have been at the center of these problems caused by my
ignorance.  These issues seem to stress people out and slow down our process.

Fights over authority
---------------------

No one is able to say with certainty who has authority in any given matter.
Usually, the problem then goes from one committee to another and the whole
process is slowed down significantly.

If we were to institute ruling elders as prescribed in the New Testament, there
would be no question as to who has the authority to make a certain decision.
The answer would always be *the elders do*.

Number of leaders
-----------------

I think we can all agree that having too many leaders is counterproductive.

Congregational votes
--------------------

John MacArthur writes:

> In many churches today the congregation rules the leaders.  This sort of
> government is foreign to the New Testament.[^6]

I don't think that congregational democracy has much practical sense for the
local church.  Suppose that a great revival broke out in the Bedford area and a
few hundred new believers were added to our flock.[^13]  New believers tend to
be spiritually immature and easily swayed.  Suppose we were to have a
congregational vote on a delicate issue such as whether or not we should allow
gay marriages to be officiated in our church.  The new believers, outnumbering
the original believers, could easily affect the church's decision in one way or
the other.  Instead, we should select mature Christians whose experience and
knowledge of the Scriptures is deep to make these kinds of decisions.  I
believe that Paul prescribes the elders to be such people.

Moreover, going back to the description of biblical polity, the flock of
believers needs to have shepherds.  As we know, sheep aren't the smartest of
animals and need a strong leading hand.  Our current system supposes that sheep
are capable of leading themselves.

Business-likeness of church meetings
------------------------------------

Currently, we consider our meeting procedures to be very important.  The proper
conduct during meetings is followed and closely monitored.  For example, when a
committee wishes to make a decision, it's done by passing a motion.  All
committee members then express their opinion by saying *yay* or *nay*.  When a
meeting is concluded, the secretary produces meeting minutes that are then
approved at the following meeting.  There are guidelines on how to create
meeting minutes and certain things aren't permitted to be included in them.

Instead, all rigorous structures should be removed to make room for the leading
of the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit is shown in the New Testament to produce
unexpected behavior in believers.  By reducing the amount of rules and
regulations, we can be ready to act when the Holy Spirit comes.

Christian Education
-------------------

Christian education should be handled by the elders of the church and not by
individuals selected from the congregation.  The elders are called to teach and
preach the gospel.

Pastors
-------

As indicated above, pastors are in fact elders and they should be given the
same privileges as other elders.  Mainly, they should be able to rule.
Currently, pastors at Bedford Baptist Church don't rule; they only advise and
educate.

Steps towards biblical polity
=============================

While I would like us to see the biblical truth and at once decide to be
obedient to it, I don't think this can realistically happen in a short period
of time.  There needs to be a church-wide initiative to teach what the Bible
commands in terms of church government.

We should pray for the Holy Spirit to fill the hearts of our people and be
receptive to new ideas.  We should seek to explain and correct in love.  We
should be tender-hearted towards critics.  We cannot make great progress
without a spirit of gentleness.

Dissolve all boards and committees
----------------------------------

As the Bible doesn't prescribe any administrative bodies under the deacon
level, we should do away with them altogether.  This will free up a great many
people to do more work for the kingdom.  More practically, this means that the
leadership of the church will be reduced from over a hundred people to about
twenty or thirty.

Establish elders and deacons
----------------------------

We should select from our midst a number of elders to lead the church.  We
should include current pastors in the group of elders in obedience to the New
Testament.  We should ascribe to them ruling power.

Once we have establish elders, the elders should select and appoint as many
deacons as necessary.

Prevent congregation from making decisions
------------------------------------------

Altering the constitution to remove decision-making power from the congregation
might be more difficult than it seems.  What we will be asking our people is to
vote to have their voting privileges stripped, and to be fully submissive the
newly appointed elders of the church.

Conclusion
==========

If we truly believe that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God and if we trust
that our God has the best intentions for us, we should have a desire to be
obedient to his commandments.  Knowing the will of God and not acting on it is
a serious offense.

I would like to start a dialog around this issue.  I welcome any feedback,
criticism, request for clarification and so on.
